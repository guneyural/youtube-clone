# Youtube Clone

Youtube UI and animations made with React Native.

Inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQGV_FDvS-Q&t=17122s). I took JSON data (Video Title, thumbnail, video link, etc.) from this project.

Made it all by myself with extra features and without using any bottom sheet library.

My app is enhanced version of the app in the video. You can see the working example of the app that gave me the inspiration by [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQGV_FDvS-Q&t=17122s).
